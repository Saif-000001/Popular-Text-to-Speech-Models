This research evaluates the accuracy of a Text-to-Speech (TTS) system by synthesizing speech from text and using an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model to transcribe the audio back into text. Pre-trained models (SpeechT5 and Wav2Vec2) are used for speech generation and transcription. The accuracy is determined by comparing the original text with the transcribed output, calculating the percentage of correctly transcribed words. This approach provides a quantifiable measure of how well the TTS system replicates the intended speech and helps identify areas for improvement in speech synthesis.
